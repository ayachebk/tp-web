  <h1>Virtualization</h1>
  <p>In computing, <b>Virtualization</b> refers to the act of creating a
  virtual <i>(rather than actual)</i> version of something.<br>This include virtual computer hardware, virtual storage devices and virtual network resources.</p>
  <hr>
  <h1>Levels of Virtualization</h1>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Virtualization at Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) level</b></li>
    <p>Every machine has an instruction set. This instruction set is an interface between software and hardware. Using this instructions software can <br>communicate with hardware.</p>
    <li><b>Virtualizaion at Operating System(O.S.) level</b></li>
    <p>In Virtualizaion at HAL level each virtual machine is built from scratch i.e. by installing O.S., application suites, networikng systems, etc.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>In cloud sometimes, we need to initialize 100 Virtual machines at a single time, if we use virtualization at Hardware abstraction layer <br>(HAL) level this can take to much time.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>So, to overcome this in Virtualizaion at Operating systems level we share operation system between Virtual machines along with the <br>hardware</li>
    </ul>
